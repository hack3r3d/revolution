# General Strike June 13, 2022
We need to face reality. Those elected to represent us don't. They are too comfortable in their positions of power. We need to change that.

Labor drives this nation's economy. On June 13, 2022, let's turn it off. Take the day off of work. Call in sick. Quit your job. Don't go shopping. Don't buy gas. Don't do anything. 

We shut the economy down for a day.

They know that our power is greater than their power, we need to know that. We need use our power to demand action on climate change, combatting gun violence, voting right, women's rights, workers' rights, corruption, etc.

Those in power need to know that we're paying attention. They need to know that we're not happy. And they need to take actions to make us happy, or we shut the economy down over and over until they do make us happy.

Save the date
